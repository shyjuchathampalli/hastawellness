        briefing="Mesotherapy is a minimally invasive technique where vitamins, enzymes, and hyaluronic acid are injected into the skin. This treatment hydrates, tightens, and rejuvenates dull and tired-looking skin.
Ideal for the face, neck, and dÃ©colletage, mesotherapy boosts elasticity and promotes a youthful glow. Regular sessions reduce fine lines and improve skin texture. Whether for hydration or anti-aging, this solution offers visible improvements and long-term benefits for skin health."
